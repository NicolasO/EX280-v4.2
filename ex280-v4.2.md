# RedHat ex280v42 Preparation Guide

## What it is

This preparation guide is written for Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration exam for OpenShift V4.2.

- Exam format: task based. The exam itself contains a set of tasks (16) that you have to perform, which represents the tasks for an OpenShift administrator.

- Exam duration: 3 hours

## Completion

The following procedure enables tab completion for Bash.

Save the Bash completion code to a file. 
```
oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion
```

Copy the file to /etc/bash_completion.d/.
```
sudo cp oc_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
```

## Manage OpenShift Container Platform

Executing troubleshooting commands:

- Getting node informations:
```
oc get node
oc describe node <nodename>
```

- Getting busiest nodes
```
oc adm top nodes
```

- Getting `journalctl` logs from a node
```
oc adm node-logs -u kubelet my-node-name
```

- Running a remote shell for a node
```
oc debug node/<nodename>
```

- Work with cluster installers
```
oc get clusteroperators
oc get clusterversion -o yaml
```

- Getting a pod logs
```
oc logs <pod> [-c <container>] [-f]
```

- Debugging a deployment or a pod
```
oc debug deployment/<deplname> [--as-root]
oc rsh <podname>
oc port-forward <pod> <localport>:<remoteport>
```

- Getting a file from a pod
```
oc cp file <pod>:/file
oc cp <pod>:/file file
```

## Manage Users and Policies

Removing the default kubeadmin:
```
oc delete secret kubeadmin -n kube-system
```

Working with htpasswd

- Create: `htpasswd -c -B -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat123`
- Update: `htpasswd -b /tmp/htpasswd student redhat1234`

Create a secret:
```
oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret \
> --from-file htpasswd=/tmp/htpasswd -n openshift-config
```

Adding to OAuth:
```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider
    mappingMethod: claim
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpasswd-secret
```

Getting users and identities
```
oc get users
oc get identity
```

## Manage Resource Access

Defining and Applying Permissions Using RBAC  
```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin username
oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user cluster-admin username
oc adm policy who-can delete user
oc adm policy add-role-to-user basic-user dev -n wordpress
```

Default roles
-	**basic-user** Users with this role have read access to the project.
-	**cluster-admin** Users with this role have superuser access to the cluster resources. These users can perform any action on the cluster, and have full control of all projects.
-	**cluster-status** Users with this role can get cluster status information.
-	**self-provisioner** Users with this role can create new projects.

Default roles that can be added or removed from a project level:
-	**admin** Users with this role can manage all project resources, including granting access to other users to the project.
-	**edit** Users with this role can create, change, and delete common application resources from the project, such as services and deployment configurations. These users cannot act on management resources such as limit ranges and quotas, and cannot manage access permissions to the project.
-	**view** Users with this role can view project resources, but cannot modify project resources.

System users: system:admin, system:openshift-registry, and system:node:node1.example.com.

Managing Sensitive Information with Secrets  
```
oc create secret generic secret_name \
> --from-literal key1=secret1 \
> --from-literal key2=secret2
oc secrets add --for mount serviceaccount/serviceaccount-name \
> secret/secret_name
oc set env dc/demo --from=secret/demo-secret
oc set volume dc/demo \
> --add \
> --type=secret \
> --secret-name=demo-secret \
> --mount-path=/app-secrets
```

Controlling Application Permissions with Security Context Constraints (SCCs) (anyuid, privileged etc)  
```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
```


## Configure Networking Components

Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalService
```
oc describe dns.operator/default
```
CoreDNS entries:
•	A `svcname.namespace.svc.cluster.local`
•	SRV `_port-name._port-protocol.svc.namespace.svc.cluster.local`

```
oc get Network.config.openshift.io cluster -o yaml
```

Ingress rule:
```
oc get ingress
```

Certificate generation:
```
openssl genrsa -out file.key
openssl req -new -subj <subject> -out file.req -key file.key
openssl x509 -req -in file.req -out file.crt -signkey file.key
```

Secure route (edge/passthru):
```
oc create route edge \
> --service <svcname> --hostname <host>.apps.acme.com \
> --key file.key --cert file.crt
```

## Configure Pod Scheduling

I think this topic has the most weight over all the topics in this exam.

Controlling pod scheduling behavior (factors that can affect on which nodes a pod can or cannot be run)  
```
oc label node node1.us-west-1.compute.internal env[-|=dev] [--overwrite]
oc get node node2.us-west-1.compute.internal --show-labels
oc get node -L failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region
oc patch deployment/myapp --patch \
> '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"nodeSelector":{"env":"dev"}}}}}'
oc adm new-project demo --node-selector "tier=1"
oc annotate namespace demo \
> openshift.io/node-selector="tier=2" --overwrite
```

Limiting resource usage (factors that can affect the resources that a pod is allowed use or run)  
```
oc adm top nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
oc set resources deployment hello-world-nginx \
> --requests cpu=10m,memory=20Mi --limits cpu=80m,memory=100Mi
oc create quota dev-quota --hard services=10,cpu=1300,memory=1.5Gi -n <ns>
oc get resourcequota -n <ns>
oc describe limitrange dev-limits
```

A violation of LimitRange constraints prevents pod creation, and resulting error messages are displayed. A violation of ResourceQuota constraints prevents a pod from being scheduled to any node. The pod might be created but remain in the pending state

```
oc create clusterquota user-qa \
> --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=qa \
> --hard pods=12,secrets=20
oc create clusterquota env-qa \
> --project-label-selector environment=qa \
> --hard pods=10,services=5
```

Scaling an Application  
```
oc scale --replicas 3 deployment/myapp
oc autoscale dc/hello --min 1 --max 10 --cpu-percent 80
oc get hpa
```

## Configure Cluster Scaling

Manually Scaling an OpenShift Cluster  
```
oc scale --replicas=2 \
> machineset MACHINE-SET -n openshift-machine-api
```

Automatically Scaling an OpenShift Cluster
```
oc get clusterautoscaler
oc get machineautoscaler -n openshift-machine-api
```



## Exercices

The good practice can be the RHLS Labs from DO280. During the Exam you will have access to Web Console, don't hesitate to use it.
